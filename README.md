# Swft
Swft is a decentralized classified advertising website that allows users to buy and sell their used goods for cryptocurrencies. We provide users the ability to buy and sell used items on a secure and transparent Blockchain. Swft will utilize the newest technology in the FinTech industry to allow users to create their auction markets. Using SmartContract technology will help us generate virtual auction markets on the Blockchain. Users will be able to create an auction, declare the asset for sale and duration for the sale, set an initial price, and cancel the auction if they wish to do so. The participants within the Swft Blockchain Community will be able to place a bid at a certain amount.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87771983/156027620-54ae8e82-207c-4e02-9851-43758bc81eb1.png)
